<p>In this tutorial, we cover tkinter event handling. In this scenario, we are adding a quit event to our quit button, which currently does nothing when clicked on. In basically every circumstance, we're going to want to have our buttons actually do something or perform an action rather than just appear there. This is called an event when someone clicks on something, and we can write code to handle events. Generally, we want to write code that is in line what the expectation of the user that created the event. The more in-line your program can be with what the user intends to happen with their events, the more user-friendly it is going to be.</p>

<p>In tkinter, event handling is as simple as adding a command, which we'll make into a function. Even though this function we create is a basic 1-line function that simply calls another function, we can see how we can later create more complex functions for our events.</p>

    # Define settings upon initialization. Here you can specify
    def __init__(self, master=None):
