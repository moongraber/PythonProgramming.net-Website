		<p>The two distinctive loops we have in Python 3 logic are the "for loop" and the "while loop." Both of them achieve very similar results, and can almost always be used interchangeably towards a goal. Many times it comes down to programmer preference, or is reliant on efficiency. Generally, the for loop can be more efficient than the while loop, but not always.</p>
		<p>The idea of the While loop is:</p>
		<p>While something is the case, do the following block of code.</p>
		<p>Here is an example of a while loop:</p>
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<pre  class="prettyprint">condition = 1

while condition < 10:
	print(condition)
	condition += 1
		</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>In this code, we have defined a variable name condition, and condition starts at a value of 1.</p>
		</div></div>
		
		

		<p>Next, we specify the terms of the while statement, which are : While the condition variable is less than 10, we will print the condition variable out.
		After printing out the condition, we will add 1 to the current condition.</p>

		<p>This process will continue until condition equals 10.</p>

		<p>There is usually more complex code within the while loop. If you are not familiar with what a code block is, in the case of the while loop above, the "code block" within the while loop is:</p>
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<pre  class="prettyprint">	print(condition)
	condition += 1
		</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>This setup of a while loop is known as creating a "counter," since basically that is what we're doing. We're saying we just want to count 1 for every iteration and eventually stop at our limit. While loops are usually finite and defined in this sense, but while loops can also be undefined. Something like:</p>
		</div></div>

		<p>Assuming we had something built to detect weather:</p>
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<pre  class="prettyprint">while isRaining:
	print(condition)
		</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>In this case, this loop would continue running while it was raining outside. When the rain stopped, the loop would cease.</p>
		</div></div>

		
		<p>Another example is what is known as the infinite loop. This is easiest done with the help of a while loop.</p>
		
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<pre  class="prettyprint">while True:
	print('doing stuff!!')
		</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>If you actually run the above code, you can stop it by doing ctrl+c to break it. The above is an intentional infinite loop.</p>
		</div></div>

		<p>Sometimes people unintentionally make infinite loops through flaws in their code, however. Say for example you are getting inches of rainfall from a database, and you are accidentally reading the data in as a string:</p>
		
		
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<pre  class="prettyprint">condition = '2'

while condition > 5:
	print 'test'
		</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>Here, even though 2 is less than 5, and we'd expect this to not run, the string takes precedence and will allow this while loop to run, infinitely, no matter what number the string contains.</p>
		</div></div>
