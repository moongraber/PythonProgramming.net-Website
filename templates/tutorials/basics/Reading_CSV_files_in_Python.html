<p>This Python 3 tutorial covers how to read CSV data in from a file and then use it in Python. For this, we use the csv module. CSV literally stands for comma separated variable, where the comma is what is known as a "delimiter." While you can also just simply use Python's split() function, to separate lines and data within each line, the CSV module can also be used to make things easy.</p>

<p>Here is the sample code that matches the video:</p>

<p>Example CSV file data:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">1/2/2014,5,8,red
1/3/2014,5,2,green
1/4/2014,9,1,blue
</pre>
&nbsp;

<p>Next, let's cover the reading of CSV files into memory:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
import csv

with open('example.csv') as csvfile:
    readCSV = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    for row in readCSV:
        print(row)
        print(row[0])
        print(row[0],row[1],row[2],)
</pre>

<p>Above, we've shown how to open a CSV file and read each row, as well as reference specific data on each row.</p>

<p>Next, we will show how to pull out specific data from the spreadsheet and save it to a list variable:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
import csv

with open('example.csv') as csvfile:
    readCSV = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    dates = []
    colors = []
    for row in readCSV:
        color = row[3]
        date = row[0]

        dates.append(date)
        colors.append(color)

    print(dates)
    print(colors)
</pre>

<p>Once we have this data, what can we do with it? Maybe we are curious about what color something was on a specific date.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
import csv

with open('example.csv') as csvfile:
    readCSV = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    dates = []
    colors = []
    for row in readCSV:
        color = row[3]
        date = row[0]

        dates.append(date)
        colors.append(color)

    print(dates)
    print(colors)

    # now, remember our lists?

    whatColor = input('What color do you wish to know the date of?:')
    coldex = colors.index(whatColor)
    theDate = dates[coldex]
    print('The date of',whatColor,'is:',theDate)
</pre>

<p>Simple enough! If we enter something that doesn't exist, we get an ugly error.</p>
