	  <h2>Python, Programming, and using PythonProgramming.net</h2>
	  <br>
	  <p>Chances are, if you're viewing this page, you're brand new to Python.</p>
	  <p>You might even be new to Programming all-together. Either way, 
		you have come to the right place, and chosen the right language!</p>
	  <p><strong>Why Python?</strong></p>
	  <p>Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understand even if you do not know any programming. Let me show you:</p>
	  
	  <div class="row">
	  <div class="col-md-6">
	  <pre class="prettyprint">
Garage = "Ferrari", "Honda", "Porsche", "Toyota"
	  
for each_car in Garage:
	print(each_car)
	  </pre></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><p>"print()" is a built-in Python function that will output some text to the <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#consoleinfo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="consoleinfo">console</kbd>.</p>
		<div class="collapse" id="consoleinfo">
		  <div class="well">
			<p>When someone refers to "the console," they are referring to where information from your program is ouput. You will see an example of "output to console" below. If you want this message to go away, just click again on the "console" button that you originally clicked on.</p>
		  </div>
		</div></div></div>

		<p>Whenever you see a word encased in blue like "console" is above, you can click on it for more information, and click it again to make the information disappear again. Any words or phrases that may not be known by everyone will have this functionality.</p>
		
		<p>Looking at the code about cars in the garage, can you guess what will happen? You probably have a general idea. For each_car in the garage, we're going to do something. What are we doing? We are printing each car.</p>
		
		<p>Since "printing" outputs some text to the "console," you can probably figure out that the console will say something like "Ferrari, Honda, Porsche, Toyota."</p>
		
		<p>But hey, let's not take my word for it, let's try it! Here's an editor and console for you. Feel free to run the pre-existing code, and then just delete all of the code there.</p>
		
		<p>Next, copy and paste the garage code above into the editor (left side) so it is the only code in the editor ... then click run and see if the output is as expected.:</p>

		<p>Look at you, you're a programmer now! Now there's no turning back.</p>
	
		<strong>What can Python do?</strong>
		<p>Python is a fully-functional programming language that can do <i>anything</i> almost any other language can do, at comprable speeds.</p>
		<p>Python is capable of threading and GPU processing just like any other language. Most of the data processing <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#modules" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="modules">modules</kbd> are actually just Python <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#wrappers" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="wrappers">wrappers</kbd> around C/C++ code.</p>
		
		<div class="collapse" id="modules">
		  <div class="well">
			<p>"Modules" are pre-written Python code that you "import" in your Python program. Since there are many tasks that people commonly do, we have modules that people have written that do these taks for you, and they usually do them in the cleanest and most efficient method possible. Sometimes you will see people refer to "DRY." This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, which often also translates into "Don't Repeat Someone Else."</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="collapse" id="wrappers">
		  <div class="well">
			<p>The phrase "wrapper" means that someone has placed, like a wrapper, Python code over another language. So, when you have a Python wrapper around C++ code, what someone has done is written some Python code that interacts with the C++ language. This allows you to make use of various aspects of the language being wrapped, in this case C++, without actually needing to know or understand that language.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<p>Thus, Python can be used to make games, do data analysis, control robot and hardware, create <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#GUIS" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="GUIS">GUIs</kbd>, or even to create websites.</p>
		<div class="collapse" id="GUIS">
		  <div class="well">
			<p>"GUI" stands for Graphical User Interface, and is used to describe a program that incorporates graphics to make the program more interactive for the user.</p>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		<p>99% of the code that brings this very page to you is actually Python code!</p>
		
		<p>If you're curious to see some examples of what you can do with Python code, browse around the topics in the <kbd data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Dashboard" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="Dashboard">Dashboard</kbd>.</p>
