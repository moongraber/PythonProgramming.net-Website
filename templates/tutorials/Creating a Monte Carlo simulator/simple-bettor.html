so now we've got a bettor, he's working, and we've seen some basic outcomes
but now we want to see some longer-term outcomes, so first let's do that.

		<p><p>Interestingly enough, you can see there is quite the spread here.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the odds are only 1% against you. </p>

<p>Now we can see most people have gone broke, all but 1 person is either
broke or a loser. Interestingly sometimes you find people actually
make large profits.</p>

<p>This visualization, however, is sub par. let's add to this, shall we?</p>
