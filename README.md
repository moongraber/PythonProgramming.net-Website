# PythonProgramming.net-Website

This is the source code to the actual PythonProgramming.net website.

I am hosting the code here for the curious on-looker, but also seeking constructive criticism, as well as most importantly: support

PythonProgramming.net has begun as a hack-job. It functions, and it is actually very efficient at running, taking up far less processing than the wordpress version did, even with the increase of users.

If you would like to contribute, see the contributing.md, or check out the issues tab. You can also submit an issue I believe.
