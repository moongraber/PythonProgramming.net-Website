#Contributing Guidlines

This project is open source, and it is my hope that people will contribute to help make it into something great.

For specific issues, see the issues tab.

Here are some examples of contributions:
-General functionality concepts (handling users, CMS, etc.)
-Code fixes and new implementations
-Written tutorial updates or improvements

The main concern is the UI/UX. If you wish to fix the actual source code itself from the tutorials (for example, updating the code from the MPI tutorials)
, then you are better off editing the source in that repository. 

Regarding UI/UX, I am very interested in:
-Dashboard improvements (Suggestions: Better organization, saving tab location: this way someone can link specifically to the machine learning tab, rather than forcing the user to click through), tutorial suggestions.
-Search: I have been thinking of simply using and re-skinning google search for the easiest, but a nice search in some form would be great. 
-Tutorial Navigation

All changes must come with complete explanations to the reason and purpose for the change.
